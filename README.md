# OAuth Mobile Web SSO Code Example

Demo mobile apps and SPA, to demonstrate the nonce authenticator pattern on a development computer.\
This provides an additional Single Sign On (SSO) option between mobile and web apps, to prevent a double login.

## Run the Code Example

The following components are called, from a mobile emulator or device.\
The SPA and OAuth agent are hosted on the same domain, behind a Docker based reverse proxy.\
This ensures that the HTTP-only cookies issued to the SPA are first-party:

![Components](./doc/components.jpg)

Build and deploy the system with the following commands:

```bash
./build.sh
./deploy.sh
```

To enable a setup that works on a standalone computer, an ngrok base URL is used:

```bash
The internet base URL is: https://c7b9-2-26-158-168.eu.ngrok.io
```

Mobile and web apps running on devices or emulators then have full connectivity, over HTTPS URLs.\
Backend components use URLs similar to the following values:

| Component | Internet URL |
| --------- | ------------ |
| Web Host | https://c7b9-2-26-158-168.eu.ngrok.io/spa |
| OAuth Agent | https://c7b9-2-26-158-168.eu.ngrok.io/oauth-agent |
| Curity Identity Server Runtime URL | https://c7b9-2-26-158-168.eu.ngrok.io |

The Curity Identity Server Admin UI is available at `https://localhost:6749/admin`.\
Sign in with credentialsÂ `admin / Password1` to inspect the OAuth configuration.

## Application Flow

Run the mobile client from Android Studio or Xcode, and an unauthenticated view will be shown:

| Android | iOS |
| ------- | --- |
| <img src="./doc/android-app.jpg" /> | <img src="./doc/ios-app.jpg" />

Click the login button and sign in as `demouser / Password1`.

| Android | iOS |
| ------- | --- |
| <img src="./doc/android-login.jpg" /> | <img src="./doc/ios-login.jpg" />

The authenticated view will then be presented, to enable navigation to the SPA:

| Android | iOS |
| ------- | --- |
| <img src="./doc/android-navigation.jpg" /> | <img src="./doc/ios-navigation.jpg" />

The mobile app posts its ID token to the nonce authenticator in order to get a one-time token.\
It then passes the nonce in a query string parameter to the SPA, when loading it in a browser.\
The SPA then runs an OpenID Connect redirect that authenticates the user automatically, using the nonce:

| <img src="./doc/android-sso.jpg" /> | <img src="./doc/ios-sso.jpg" />

## Mobile OAuth Flow

- Get a nonce and pass it to the webview
- Use OAuth tools to sign in as the web client, to verify the authenticator

## Web OAuth Flow

- Deploy oauth-agent
- Minor look and feel improvements to SPA
- Get local setup working for web development and add a sub README on local development
- SPA unauthenticated and authenticated views
- Use the nonce when the SPA loads with it as a query param
- Do I need WebViewCache?
- Filter out nonce authenticator from standard logins

## Android

- Equivalent behavior
